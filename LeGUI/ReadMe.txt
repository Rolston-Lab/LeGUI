Description of files generated by LeGUI

ChannelMap.mat (These variables should be used for analysis since they are mapped to recorded data channels)
  *LabelMap: Cell of labels specifying electrode location and contact number (i.e. ROFC1 for right orbital frontal cortex contact 1) in 2D layout to approximate actual electrode layout
  *ChannelMap1: Matrix of recorded channel numbers in 2D layout to approximate actual electrode layout
  *ChannelMap2: If data was recorded using two systems this can be used for mapping 2nd system (if different)
  *DepthElec: List of channel numbers from either ChannelMap1 or 2 that represent depth electrodes
  *MicroElec: List of channel numbers from either ChannelMap1 or 2 that represent micro electrodes
  *GndElec: List of channel numbers from either ChannelMap1 or 2 that represent ground electrodes
  *RefElec: List of channel numbers from either ChannelMap1 or 2 that represent reference electrodes
  *AtlasNames: Cell of atlas names that correspond to the columns of ElecAtlasProj
  *ElecAtlasProj: Cell of atlas labels where rows represent recorded channel and columns represent a specific atlas
  *ElecAtlasProbProj: Cell of atlas label probabilities taken from a 1cm search radius where rows represent recorded channel and columns represent results for a specific atlas
  *ElecTypeProj: Cell of gray/white/unknown labels where rows represent recorded channel
  *ElecCOMIdxProj: Matrix of voxel indices (row/col/page) that represent the center-of-mass of each electrode where rows represent recorded channel
  *ElecFullIdxProj: Cell of voxel indices that represent the volume of each electrode where rows represent recorded channel
  *ElecXYZProj: Matrix of electrode locations (x/y/z) in patient world space (units mm) where rows represent recorded channel
  *ElecXYZMNIProj: Matrix of electrode locations in standard MNI space (units mm) where rows represent recorded channel
	
Electrodes.mat (These variables are used by the GUI and are organized by draw-order of electrodes)
  *BrainSurfRaw: Faces/vertices for brain surface
  *SkullSurfRaw: Faces/vertices for a highly processed skull surface that is used to define vectors and project electrodes
  *ElecMapRaw: Cell where rows represent electrode draw-order and columns represent values from LabelMap, ChannelMap1, and ChannelMap2
  *DepthElecRaw: List of depth electrodes numbered by corresponding row in ElecMapRaw
  *MicroElecRaw: List of micro electrodes numbered by corresponding row in ElecMapRaw
  *GndElecRaw: List of ground electrodes numbered by corresponding row in ElecMapRaw
  *RefElecRaw: List of reference electrodes numbered by corresponding row in ElecMapRaw
  *AtlasNames: Cell of atlas names that correspond to the columns of ElecAtlasRaw and ElecAtlasProjRaw
  *ElecAtlasRaw: Cell of atlas labels where rows represent electrode draw-order and columns represent a specific atlas
  *ElecAtlasProjRaw: Projected version of ElecAtlasRaw
  *ElecAtlasProbProjRaw: Cell of atlas label probabilities taken from a 1cm search radius where rows represent electrode draw-order and columns represent results for a specific atlas
  *ElecTypeRaw: Cell of gray/white/unknown labels where rows represent electrode draw-order
  *ElecTypeProjRaw: Projected version of ElecTypeRaw
  *ElecCOMIdxRaw: Matrix of voxel indices (row/col/page) that represent the center-of-mass of each electrode where rows represent electrode draw-order
